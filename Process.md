# 1.Onboarding Screen:

I've created a modern onboarding screen with the following features:

## Dark Theme & Gradients:

- Used LinearGradient for the background with dark tones
- Implemented glassmorphism effect using transparent backgrounds
- Added subtle animations with react-native-reanimated

## Layout & Components:

- Created a responsive layout using Flexbox and useWindowDimensions
- Implemented a reusable FeatureItem component for feature highlights
- Used SafeAreaView for proper device compatibility

## Styling:

- Added gradient effects for the button
- Implemented proper typography hierarchy
- Added smooth animations for content entry

## Features:

- Bold title with gradient highlight
- Descriptive subtitle
- Three feature items with icons
- Gradient CTA button

The screen is now ready, but you'll need to add the following assets to the /assets directory:

- finance-illustration.png: Main illustration
- income-icon.png: Income feature icon
- expense-icon.png: Expense feature icon
- credit-icon.png: Credit feature icon

I've made several improvements to the onboarding screen:

## Removed External Dependencies:

Created custom SVG icons for finance, income, expense, and credit features
Icons are now part of the codebase, making it more portable

## UI Improvements:

Adjusted the illustration size to be more proportional
Added smooth animations using react-native-reanimated
Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces
Used the theme colors consistently throughout the UI

## Added Dependencies:

- Installed required packages: expo-linear-gradient, expo-image, react-native-reanimated, and react-native-safe-area-context
- Created babel.config.js with proper configuration for reanimated

## The screen now features:

- A dark gradient background
- Glowing gradient text for the title
- Glassmorphism effect for feature cards
- Smooth entrance animations
- Custom SVG icons with consistent styling
- Proper safe area handling
- Responsive layout

You can now run the app, and you should see a beautiful onboarding screen with smooth animations and a modern dark theme. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the design or add any additional features?

3. #Profile Screen:
   I've created a beautiful profile page with a dark glassmorphism style using minimal external dependencies. Here's what I've implemented:

## Dark Gradient Background:

Using LinearGradient from expo-linear-gradient (already installed) for the black to dark purple background.

## Profile Header:

- Animated glowing avatar with gradient border
- User's name in large, bold text
- Profession displayed below in a softer color

## Profile Details:

Glassmorphic cards with translucent backgrounds
Icons for email, phone, and member since date
Clean layout with proper spacing and typography

## Interactive Elements:

- Gradient "Edit Profile" button with a teal-to-green gradient
- "Log Out" button with a red gradient and icon
- Subtle hover states through opacity changes

## Animations:

- Subtle glow animation on the avatar border using Animated
- Smooth transitions and interactions

The design uses minimal dependencies, relying mainly on:

- React Native's built-in components
- Expo's LinearGradient (already installed)
- Ionicons for icons (part of @expo/vector-icons)

The UI follows modern design principles with:

- Proper spacing and hierarchy
- Consistent color scheme
- Glassmorphism effects through translucent backgrounds
  Gradient accents for visual interest

#### update:

I've enhanced the profile page with several new components and features while maintaining the dark glassmorphism style and using the theme colors. Here are the key additions:

## Stats Section:

- Added a row of stat cards showing total transactions, total saved amount, and monthly average expense
- Each stat card has a glassmorphic background with the theme's highlight color for values

## Section Headers:

- Added clear section headers with icons for better organization
- "Profile Information" and "Settings" sections with themed icons

## Preferences Section:

- Added a new preferences section with toggle switches
- Includes notification and dark mode toggles
- Currency preference display
- Beautiful glassmorphic container with subtle borders

## Styling Improvements:

- Using theme colors consistently throughout the UI
- Added ScrollView for better content management
- Improved spacing and typography
- Enhanced glassmorphism effects using theme's glass color

## Mock Data:

- Extended the mock data to include stats and preferences
- Added proper currency formatting for monetary values

The profile page now provides much more information about the user while maintaining a clean, modern, and cohesive design that matches your app's theme. The glassmorphism effects create depth and visual interest, while the color scheme ensures good readability and visual hierarchy.
