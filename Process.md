# 1.Onboarding Screen:

I've created a modern onboarding screen with the following features:

## Dark Theme & Gradients:

- Used LinearGradient for the background with dark tones
- Implemented glassmorphism effect using transparent backgrounds
- Added subtle animations with react-native-reanimated

## Layout & Components:

- Created a responsive layout using Flexbox and useWindowDimensions
- Implemented a reusable FeatureItem component for feature highlights
- Used SafeAreaView for proper device compatibility

## Styling:

- Used the existing theme colors and spacing
- Added gradient effects for the button
- Implemented proper typography hierarchy
- Added smooth animations for content entry

## Features:

- Bold title with gradient highlight
- Descriptive subtitle
- Three feature items with icons
- Gradient CTA button

The screen is now ready, but you'll need to add the following assets to the /assets directory:

- finance-illustration.png: Main illustration
- income-icon.png: Income feature icon
- expense-icon.png: Expense feature icon
- credit-icon.png: Credit feature icon

I've made several improvements to the onboarding screen:

## Removed External Dependencies:

Replaced external image files with inline SVG icons using data URLs
Created custom SVG icons for finance, income, expense, and credit features
Icons are now part of the codebase, making it more portable

## UI Improvements:

Adjusted the illustration size to be more proportional
Added smooth animations using react-native-reanimated
Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces
Used the theme colors consistently throughout the UI

## Added Dependencies:

- Installed required packages: expo-linear-gradient, expo-image, react-native-reanimated, and react-native-safe-area-context
- Created babel.config.js with proper configuration for reanimated

## The screen now features:

- A dark gradient background
- Glowing gradient text for the title
- Glassmorphism effect for feature cards
- Smooth entrance animations
- Custom SVG icons with consistent styling
- Proper safe area handling
- Responsive layout

You can now run the app, and you should see a beautiful onboarding screen with smooth animations and a modern dark theme. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the design or add any additional features?
